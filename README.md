# Customer Behavior Analysis Using Descriptive Statistics

## Project Overview
This project applies probability and statistics concepts to analyze a real-world dataset containing customer information and purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can optimize marketing efforts and increase offer acceptance rates. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), descriptive statistics, probability distributions, and segmentation of customers.

## Problem Statement
Objective
The primary goal is to analyze the provided dataset to make data-driven decisions. Specifically, the objective is to:

Identify patterns in customer behavior.
Understand the correlation between different variables.
Segment customers based on their purchasing habits.
Provide actionable insights to optimize marketing efforts.

## Tasks
Task 1 - Basic Cleanup
Task 2 - Descriptive Statistics
Task 3 - Probability Distributions
Task 4 - Insights and Customer Segmentation
Task 5 - Conclusion and Recommendations

## Key Insights and Findings
Missing Values: The Income column had 24 missing values, which were imputed using the median value.
Data Type Conversion: The Dt_Customer column was converted to datetime format to facilitate further analysis.
Skewness and Outliers: The Income column showed significant skewness, which was addressed by Winsorizing outliers.
Central Tendency and Dispersion: The means, medians, and standard deviations for key variables like Income, MntWines, and NumWebPurchases were calculated to understand customer spending behavior.
Segmentation: Key customer segments were identified based on purchase behaviors and demographics, helping to optimize targeted marketing efforts.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- scipy.stats

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion
This project successfully applied statistical techniques to understand customer purchasing behavior, providing insights that can help optimize marketing strategies. The customer segmentation and recommendations derived from this analysis can enhance targeting and improve offer acceptance rates
